Data Science Assignment: eCommerce Transactions Analysis
Introduction
This project is a part of the Data Science Intern Assignment. The objective is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), build a Lookalike model, and conduct customer clustering using eCommerce transactions data.

Dataset Overview
The analysis is based on three datasets:

Customers.csv:

Details about customers including ID, name, region, and signup date.
Products.csv:

Product details including ID, name, category, and price.
Transactions.csv:

Transaction data including transaction ID, customer ID, product ID, quantity, and total value.
Tasks Performed
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Insights such as top-selling products, revenue by region, and revenue by product category were derived.
Visualizations were created to showcase trends and distributions.
Lookalike Model:

Built a model to recommend similar customers based on their profiles and transaction history.
Generated a CSV file with the top 3 recommendations for the first 20 customers.
Customer Clustering:

Applied clustering techniques to group customers based on their spending habits and transaction frequency.
Evaluated clustering performance using the Davies-Bouldin Index.
File Structure
The repository contains the following files:

Data_Science_Assignment.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook with all code and outputs.
Data_Science_Assignment.pdf: PDF report summarizing the EDA, insights, and results.
Lookalike.csv: CSV file with lookalike customer recommendations.
